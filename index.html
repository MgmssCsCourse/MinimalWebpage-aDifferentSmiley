		This year in our computer science class, we will learn how to use html. Html is short for Hypertext Markup Language and 
		it's used to design websites like this one. With html, you can change the color and size of your texts, for example. It's
		not as popular as python or JavaScript, but it's used in every website you see. While it may not seem important, as it's 
		not made for security purposes, creating and designing websites still is important and fun, at least for the people that 
		enjoy doing such things. Personally, I hope that we will get to know everything there is about html, that we can try it 
		out in lessons and maybe even use it in future projects.
